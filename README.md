During this course, I was able to study the importance of Agile and Scrum Roles; specifically channling roles that will allow me to understand each role in the line of project business.
The experience of each role in the SNHU Travel Project, assisted in the journey of well- orgainzed, critical thinking.
The  importance of order will make every present and future project easier to manage. 
More specifically, delegation of roles will assist in interpreting user needs and request. 
Project Owners list certain vision and goals for their project execution. Implementation of thier consumers ideas, feedback, and concerns
paves a walk way for a successful and eventful production. Interpreting User Needs, we will need to gather information
 such as conducting interview or focus groups. Some people analyze existing projects gather more intel and information.
 Identify important requirements based on the importance and feasibility. To Implement user needs into a program, we
 look at defining features and functionality, prioritizing user needs and goals. Maintain goals that will ensure the de
 design is intuitive and meets the criteria. User stories are short, simple within descriptions of a feature. 
 This help bridge the gap between user needs and program implementations. Outlining clear communication, shift focus on value,
 prioritize development and high priority stories. I feel what is also important is Iteration and feedback. 
 Experiencing feedback from Product Owner to consumers, helps tie loose ends on production and solidfy the vision the owner
 had for the project. Attracting the right audience and increase foot traffic as well. 
 Based on the experience from the SNHU Project, the approach I have adopted is understanding the requirements and 
 possible barriers that will be declared an obstacle during production. First hand, the beginning reqirements were
clear until the owner changed their "vision". I believe that proper communication and questions would of help avoid
this obstacle in the beginning. Gathering and analyzing the user requirements from owner to consumer. The development 
of the project would in smaller, manageabale task so everyone on the team is capable of handling their parts of production
. Like I always say, "Adapt to changes and keep it pushing.." Vision changes but the dynamic of a team doesn't, so when developing a 
a clean, modular, and well-documented code, this will help us change what we need without losing time and money.
I also would look at the deployment of the code, review the comments or feedback to see if, we as a team, checked off
all the marks of the vision or do we need to revisit or revamp it. Agile methodlogies emphasize flexibilty, collaboration, and iterative
development such as Scrum, Kanban, etc. While researching, I came across Kanban which uses a board that monitors the vision of 
workflow with columns that represent different "To Do, In Progress, Done". This method speaks to my recommendation because of
the organization it provides. This methods also monitors WIP(work in progress) so setting limits on the number of tasks
in each stage to prevent bottlenecks and ensuring smooth flow of work. To be a stellar team member, is to be a member with an open mind of 
ideas. Someone who is accepting of critical feedback, person who adapts to changes, and have a impressive ways of
continuing the culture of a team. While no team is perfect, someone can always be the collard greens to the corn bread of a team.
Ensuring that we help, change, and revamp our codes together to deliver customers vision.
